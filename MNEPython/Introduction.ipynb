    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why the FLUX pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the FLUX pipeline is to provide a standard implemented as a tutorial for using some of most common toolboxes to analyze full MEG datasets. The pipeline will be used for education and as well as provide a common framework for MEG data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will focus on [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html). The core arguments for using MNE-Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MNE-Python toolbox is supported by an active and dynamic group of developers ensuring that the latest analysis tools are available.\n",
    "- The  toolbox and pipeline are open zource and henceforth compatible with Open Science approaches.\n",
    "- The toolbox is based on Python which is free (as opposed to Matlab, for instance).\n",
    "- Python is becoming the preferred programming language for novel data analyses approaches including a wealth of machine learning tools. Python modules are under constant development by a huge open sources community ensuring the availability of state-of-the-art data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target users\n",
    "\n",
    "The target users are researchers new to MNE-Python as well as more advanced users seeking to standardize their analyses. The FLUX pipeline is particular geared towards cognitive neuroscientist with an interest in task-based paradigms. The developers of the pipeline are cognitve neuroscientists with a strong interest on brain oscillations and multivariate approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the pipeline in self-studies and education\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNE Python toolbox has an excellent selection of [Tutorials](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/index.html)\n",
    " and [Examples](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_examples/index.html). Nevertheless, the options are so many that the learning curve for new users is very steep. The FLUX pipeline provides a set of procedures for what we consider best practice at this moment in time. Consistent with an Open Science approach, the FLUX pipeline provides a validated and documented approach for MEG data analysis. Each analysis step comes with explanations and illustrations. Furthermore, questions are embedded in the tutorials which will be useful for self-study or they can be used in educational settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not link back to sections on the MNE Python webpage as they will change over time; nevertheless, users are are strongly encouraged to consult the website as they develop their skills and insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The FLUX toolbox has been test using MNE Python version 1.6.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the FLUX toolbox we recommend using the standalone installers: [MNE installation](https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyther notebooks are available from Github (see [FLUX website](https://neuosc.com/flux/)); alternatively copy/paste the code from Github an execute using e.g. Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create forward models based on T1 MRIs for source modeling [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) is required.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The data set ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for the FLUX based on MNE Python is available on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004346/versions/1.0.2). It is stored as fiff-files organized in the  [MEG BIDS format](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018110). The dataset is used in the step-by-step tutorials. It is from a simple paradigm on spatial attention. The participants are asked to attend left or right to a moving grating. The task and stimulation produce robust modulations in the alpha and gamma bands. \n",
