    "## Why the FLUX pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the FLUX pipeline is to provide a standard implemented as a tutorial for using some of most common toolboxes to analyze full MEG datasets. The pipeline will be used for education and as well as provide a common framework for MEG data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will focus on [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html). The core arguments for using MNE-Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MNE-Python toolbox is supported by an active and dynamic group of developers ensuring that the latest analysis tools are available.\n",
    "- The  toolbox and pipeline are Open Source and henceforth compatible with Open Science approaches.\n",
    "- The toolbox is based on Python which is free (as opposed to Matlab, for instance).\n",
    "- Python is becoming the preferred programming language for novel data analyses approaches including a wealth of machine learning tools. Python modules are under constant development by a huge open sources community ensuring the availability of state-of-the-art data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target users\n",
    "\n",
    "The target users are researchers new to MNE-Python as well as more advanced users seeking to standardize their analyses. The FLUX pipeline is particular geared towards cognitive neuroscientist with an interest in task-based paradigms. The developers of the pipeline are cognitve neuroscientists with a strong interest on brain oscillations and multivariate approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the pipeline in self-studies and education\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNE Python toolbox has an excellent selection of [Tutorials](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/index.html)\n",
    " and [Examples](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_examples/index.html). Nevertheless, the options are so many that the learning curve for new users is very steep. The FLUX pipeline provides a set of procedures for what we consider best practice at this moment in time. Consistent with an Open Science approach, the FLUX pipeline provides a validated and documented approach for MEG data analysis. Each analysis step comes with explanations and illustrations. Furthermore, questions are embedded in the tutorials which will be useful for self-study or they can be used in educational settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not link back to sections on the MNE Python webpage as they will change over time; nevertheless, users are are strongly encouraged to consult the website as they develop their skills and insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the FLUX toolbox the following installations and downloads are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the Python environment; we recommend Anaconda3 which provide Jupyter notebooks and Spyder; see [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/)\n",
    "2. Instal MNE Python: [instructions](https://mne.tools/dev/install/index.html). To make 3D rendering possible we recommend\n",
    "\n",
    ">  conda create --name=mne --channel=conda-forge mne\n",
    "\n",
    ">  conda install --name base nb_conda_kernels  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Download the example datasets (see [FLUX website](https://neuosc.com/flux/))\n",
    "4. Get the Jupyther notebooks from Github (see [FLUX website](https://neuosc.com/flux/); alternatively copy/paste the code from Github an execute using e.g. Spyder.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create forward models based on T1 MRIs for source modeling [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) is required.   \n",
