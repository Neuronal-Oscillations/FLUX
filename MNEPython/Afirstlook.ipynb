These are placed at 102 locations each having one magnetometer and a set of two orthogonal gradiometers. The horizontal and vertical EOG data as well as the ECG were acquired together with the MEG data. The data were sampled at 1000 Hz and stored for offline analysis. Prior to sampling, a lowpass filter at ~330 Hz was applied. To record the horizontal EOG, a pair of electrodes were attached approximately 2.5 cm away from the outer canthus of each eye. To record the vertical EOG, a pair of electrodes were placed above and below the right eye in line with the pupil. The ECG was recorded from a pair of electrodes placed on the left and right collarbone. Four head position indicator coils (HPIs) were placed behind the left and right ear as well as on the left and right forehead just below the hairline. The positions of the HPIs, the nasion, the left and right preauricular points, as well as the surface points of the scalp, were digitized using a PolhemusTM device. \""
